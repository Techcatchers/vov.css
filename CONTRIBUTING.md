How to Contribute to vov.css
============================

Feel free to [open issues](https://github.com/vaibhav111tandon/vov.css/issues) and send pull requests on GitHub! When sending a
pull request, please create a new topic/feature branch, and send your pull
request from that branch. Please do *not* send pull requests from your `master`
branch because this tends to lead to merge conflicts.

If possible please add a demo for the new animation in Codepen.
